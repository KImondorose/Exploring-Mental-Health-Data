# 🧠 Welcome to the Exploring Mental Health Data Notebook!
Welcome to our Kaggle competition project Exploring Mental Health Data! In this project, we aim to explore, analyze, and model data from a synthetic mental health survey to identify factors associated with depression. This competition is part of Kaggle's 2024 Playground Series, designed to challenge and enhance our machine learning skills. Let’s dive in and uncover insights from the data!

## 🎯 Introduction
### **Competition Goal 🏁**
The goal of this competition is to explore mental health survey data and identify key factors associated with depression. By analyzing various features, we aim to make predictions that can accurately indicate the presence of depression.

### **Key Deliverables 📋**
We will produce predictions for each entry in the test set, aiming to achieve high accuracy in identifying individuals who may experience depression.

### **Evaluation Metric 🎯**
Submissions are evaluated using the Accuracy Score, meaning our predictions will be judged based on the proportion of correct classifications.

### **Approach Outline 🧩**
Our approach to the competition will include the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Visualization:** Gain initial insights into the dataset.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Create and select meaningful features.
3. **Model Training and Tuning:** Build, evaluate, and tune models.
4. **Submission Preparation:** Prepare final predictions for submission.

Note: We use Optuna for finding best hyperparameter for that we use another notebook and we are only pasting best hyperparameter here. Best Model is Catboost with default hyperparameter
